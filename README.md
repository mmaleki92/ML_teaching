### Assignment  
**Objective**: Explore clustering techniques using DBSCAN and K-means  

1. **Reference**:  
   Review the repository: [Clustering by Silhouette](https://github.com/EtzionR/Clustering-by-Silhouette)  

2. **Tasks**:  
   - Implement clustering of the dataset using **DBSCAN** and **K-means** algorithms  
   - Compare the results based on silhouette scores or other metrics  

3. **Deliverables**:  
   - Code implementation  
   - A report summarizing your findings and insights  

Ensure correctness in both implementation and documentation.
